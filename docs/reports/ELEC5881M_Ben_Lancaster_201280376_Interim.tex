\chapter*{Preface}
\label{sect:preface}
This report discusses the design, implementation, and verification, of an FPGA-based embedded processor (processor) and compiler.


A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a reprogrammable logic device that enables digital electronic designs to be realised and executed on-chip. FPGAs utilise configurable logic blocks (CLB) that can be configured to emulate primitive gates. Connecting these primitive gates with others allows the engineer to realise complex logic such as combinational gates, multiplexers, and lookup-tables. Modern FPGA devices also include components such as block-RAMs, DLLs, and DSP blocks.

An embedded processor will be designed using the Verilog hardware description language (HDL). A HDL can be thought of as a front-end to a software compiler. Other HDL front-ends exist such as VHDL. The HDL is synthesised into an retargetable intermediate form consisting of nets - a form describing the gates, flip-flops, and their interconnections. After this synthesis takes place, the intermediate net list form is transformed into implementation specific forms. As this processor is designed for FPGA implementation, processes such as "place and route" are utilised to map the net list to physical resources on the FPGA. Different processes are performed for different implementations, such as for ASICs and CPLDs.
